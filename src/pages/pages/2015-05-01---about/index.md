Hi, I'm Jiesang Xiao(肖杰桑), you could also call me Jason Shaw!

I'm a self-taught JavaScript, Android developer.

Being able to programming is my dream since I was a child. When I was sixteen years old, I always imagine to have a house and buy a computer and a bed to live alone and work remotely. Three years later, in 2017, I accomplished that goal in some coincidental way.

I always find problems in real life. Like, Could I record the order details in a place when I am purchasing, Then I'd base on the monthly expense to adjust my consumption habit. There have tons of thousand problems in real life. Solving these problems would be a life-long journey for me.
